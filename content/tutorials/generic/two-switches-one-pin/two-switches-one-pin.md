## Introduction
There are handy 20K pullup resistors (resistors connected internally between Arduino I/O pins and VCC - +5 volts in the Arduino's case) built into the Atmega chip upon which Arduino boards are based. They are accessible from software by using the digitalWrite() function, when the pin is set to an input.

This sketch exploits the pullup resistors under software control. The idea is that an external 200K resistor to ground will cause an input pin to report LOW when the internal (20K) pullup resistor is turned off. When the internal pullup resistor is turned on however, it will overwhelm the external 200K resistor and the pin will report HIGH.

One downside of the scheme (there always has to be a downside doesn't there?) is that one can't tell if both buttons are pushed at the same time. In this case the scheme just reports that sw2 is pushed. The job of the 10K series resistor, incidentally, is to prevent a short circuit if a pesky user pushes both buttons at once. It can be omitted on a center-off slide or toggle switch where the states are mutually exclusive.

 * Paul Badger 2008
 * From an idea in Electronic Design News
 *
 * Exploits the pullup resistors available on each I/O and analog pin
 * The idea is that the 200K resistor to ground will cause the input pin to report LOW when the
 * (20K) pullup resistor is turned off, but when the pullup resistor is turned on,
 * it will overwhelm the 200K resistor and the pin will report HIGH.
