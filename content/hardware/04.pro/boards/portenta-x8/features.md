<FeatureDescription>
  The Portenta X8 is a high performance board, with many exceptional features. With two microprocessors combined, the NXP® i.MX 8M Mini MPU (Linux) and STM32H747XI dual Cortex®-M7+M4 32bit low power ARM® MCU (Arduino), this board is a great source to power the upcoming generation of Industrial Internet of Things.

  <Feature title="STM32H747XI dual Cortex®-M7+M4 32bit low power Arm® MCU" image="mcu">
    X8's integrated microcontroller is the dual core STM32H747 including a Cortex® M7 running at 480 MHz and a Cortex® M4 running at 240 MHz. The M4 core is available for real time control of motors and other time-critical machinery at a barebones level. The M7 core acts as a mediator between the peripherals and the i.MX 8M Mini and runs a proprietary firmware inaccessible to the User.

  <Feature title="Two industrial-grade products in one" image="communication">
    The X8 offers the best of two approaches: the flexibility of usage of Linux combined with real-time applications. This approach allows developers to leverage the Arduino environment to perform e.g. automation control while accomplishing high-performance processes on Linux cores at the same time.
  </Feature>

  <Feature title="Containerizing system" image="configurability">
    With the so called encapsulated application, developers can isolate a single package of software, which means that the applications can run within a controlled environment. This allows developers to design device-independent software while achieving modularization, thanks to the container composition.
