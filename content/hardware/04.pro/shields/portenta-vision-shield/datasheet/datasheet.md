## The Board
The included HM-01B0 camera module has been pre-configured to work with the OpenMV libraries provided by Arduino. Based on the specific application requirements, the Portenta Vision Shield is available in two configurations with either Ethernet or LoRa® connectivity. Ethernet is designed for integration of the Portenta into wired networks and providing high bandwidth. In situations requiring long range operation at low bandwidth, LoRa® connectivity is the way to go. The multi-core processor of the Portenta H7 makes embedded vision possible by minimizing the data bandwidth required.

**Note:** The Portenta Vision Shield is available in two SKU, Ethernet (ASX00021) and LoRa® (ASX00026)


### Application Examples
Thanks to the low power consumption of the Vision Shield, it is well suited for bringing machine learning to a wide range of Industry 4.0 and IoT applications.

- **Industrial production:** The included HM-01B0 camera along with the OpenMV libraries allows for quality control of items within a manufacturing or packaging plant. The small footprint, low power consumption and LoRa®/Ethernet connectivity allows for the module to be deployed essentially anywhere so that defects are identified quickly and removed from the production environment.

- **Predictive maintenance:** The combination of machine vision and machine learning capabilities of the Vision Shield and the Portenta H7 opens up possibilities for predictive maintenance based on subtle differences in the visual representation of machinery. These capabilities are further enhanced with the two MP34DT05 MEMS microphones included in the Vision Shield.

- **Surveillance:** The Vision Shield is able to provide surveillance capabilities in areas with low Wi-Fi penetration (e.g. warehouse) and large areas (e.g. shopping centres). The OpenMV libraries enable the Vision Shield to identify objects and alert the operator via LoRa® while saving a snapshot on the microSD storage slot.

### Camera Module

The Himax HM-01B0 Module is a very low power camera with 324x324 resolution and a maximum of 60FPS depending on the operating mode. Video data is transferred over a configurable 8-bit interconnect with support for frame and line synchronization. The module delivered with the Vision Shield is the monochrome version. Configuration is achieved via a I2C connection with the Portenta H7.

HM-01B0 offers very low power image acquisition and provides the possibility to perform motion detection without main processor interaction. “Always-on” operation provides the ability to turn on the main processor when movement is detected with minimal power consumption.


### Digital Microphones
The dual MP34DT05 digital MEMS microphones are omnidirectional and operate via a capacitive sensing element with a high (64 dB) signal to noise ratio. The microphones have been configured to provide separate left and right audio over a single PDM stream.

The sensing element, capable of detecting acoustic waves, is manufactured using a specialized silicon micromachining process dedicated to produce audio sensors


### Micro SD Card Slot
A micro SD card slot is available under the Vision Shield board. Available libraries allow reading and writing to FAT16/32 formatted cards.


### Ethernet (ASX00021 Only)
Ethernet connector allows connecting to 10/100 Base TX networks using the Ethernet PHY available on the Portenta board.


### LoRa® Module (ASX00026 Only)
LoRa® connectivity is provided by the Murata CMWX1ZZABZ module. This module contains a STM32L0 processor along with a Semtech SX1276 Radio. The processor is running on Arduino open source firmware based on Semtech code.




### Power
The Portenta H7 supplies 3.3V power to the LoRa® module (ASX00026 only), microSD slot and dual microphones via the 3.3V output via the high density connector. An onboard LDO regulator supplies a 2.8V output (300mA) for the camera module.


## Board Operation


### Getting Started – IDE
If you want to program your Arduino board while offline you need to install the Arduino Desktop IDE **[1]** To connect the board to your computer, you’ll need a USB cable. This also provides power to the board, as indicated by the LED.


### Getting Started – Arduino Web Editor (Create)
All Arduino and Genuino boards, including this one, work out-of-the-box on the Arduino Web Editor **[2]**, by just installing a simple plugin.

The Arduino Web Editor is hosted online, therefore it will always be up-to-date with the latest features and support for all boards. Follow **[3]** to start coding on the browser and upload your sketches onto your board.


### Getting Started – Arduino IoT Cloud
All Arduino IoT enabled products are supported on Arduino IoT Cloud which allows you to Log, graph and analyze sensor data, trigger events, and automate your home or business.


### Getting Started – OpenMV
**NOTE!
** It is highly recommended that you ensure you have the latest bootloader on your Portenta H7 before loading OpenMV firmware.

Arduino Vision Shield and Portenta H7 are supported under OpenMV. In order to easily use OpenMV download the latest OpenMV IDE **[5] **set up Portenta H7 in boot mode by double tapping reset and connect via the connection button.
