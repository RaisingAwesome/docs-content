This example shows how to use the WiFi101OTA library to update your sketch over the air. No extra hardware is required since the update is applied directly in the upper half of the  internal flash. This means that the biggest possible size of the compiled sketch is 120 KB.

## Hardware Required

- [MKR 1000 WiFi](https://store.arduino.cc/products/arduino-mkr1000-wifi) board

***This example also works with a [WiFi Shield 101 (retired)](https://docs.arduino.cc/retired/shields/arduino-wifi-shield-101) + [Arduino Zero](https://store.arduino.cc/products/arduino-zero).***

## Walkthrough

Download the WiFi101OTA library via Library Manager

![Step 1.](assets/WiFiOTA1.png)

![Step 2](assets/WiFiOTA2.png)

Select the WiFi101OTA sketch from the "Examples" menu and tune it to match your network name and password.

![Step 3.](assets/WiFiOTA3.png)

Upload the example using the "classic" serial port method

![Step 4.](assets/WiFiOTA4.png)

Your MKR1000 will connect to the Wi-Fi and expose itself as a Network port with the name and password you declared in the sketch with `WiFiOTA.begin` (the defaults name is "Arduino" while the password is "password").

At this point you are already able to update the sketch over the air! Open another sketch and make sure to add `WiFiOTA.begin()` in `setup()` and  `WiFiOTA.poll()` in your `loop()` . If you forget about this you will lose the ability to upload over the air again (but you can still upload via serial, of course)

We are now ready to upload our new sketch wirelessly! Select the correct Network port in the Ports menu and press "Upload"

![Step 5.](assets/WiFiOTA5a.png)

You will be prompted to enter the password you configured in the `begin` . Remember to choose a strong password to avoid unauthorised access to your board!

![Step 6.](assets/WiFiOTA6.png)

Hooray! We just uploaded a new sketch over the air!

![Step 7.](assets/WiFiOTA7.png)

Open the serial port to check the new sketch is up and running

## Circuit

![The circuit for this example.](assets/ArduinoMKR1000_bb.png)

## Code

First time you upload this code, you have to do it by means of the USB cable. After the first upload you will see your board listed under the Tools->port menu in the network's port sub menu.

```arduino

/*

 This example connects to an WPA encrypted WiFi network.

 Then it prints the  MAC address of the Wifi shield,

 the IP address obtained, and other network details.

 It then polls for sketch updates over WiFi, sketches

 can be updated by selecting a network port from within

 the Arduino IDE: Tools -> Port -> Network Ports ...

 Circuit:

 * WiFi shield attached

 * SD shield attached
