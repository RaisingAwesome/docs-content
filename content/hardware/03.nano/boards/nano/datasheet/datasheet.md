## Functional Overview
### Block Diagram
![Block Diagram of Arduino Nano](./assets/nano_block_diagram.png)

### Processor

The primary processor in the Arduino Nano v3.3 board is the high-performance and low-power 8-bit ATmega328 microcontroller that runs at a clock frequency of 16 MHz. The ability to interface external devices through serial communication supported by the chip with UART TTL (5V), I2C (TWI) and SPI. Arduino Nano can be programmed with Arduino software reducing the entry barriers for new users. Smallest dimension embedded hardware makes it a perfect choice for breadboard-friendly projects from the maker community.

### Power Tree
![Power Tree of Arduino Nano](./assets/nano_power_tree.png)

The Arduino Nano can be powered by either the USB port or alternatively via VIN. The input supply of VIN is regulated by an LDO so the supply is limited to 5V for the optimal functioning of the board. There is also another regulator which limits the voltage to 3.3V for powrering the components with low voltage requirements.

## Board Operation
### Getting Started - IDE
If you want to program your Arduino® Nano while offline you need to install the Arduino® Desktop IDE **[1]** To connect the Arduino Uno to your computer, you’ll need a Micro-B USB cable. This also provides power to the board, as indicated by the LED.

### Getting Started - Arduino Web Editor
All Arduino® boards, including this one, work out-of-the-box on the Arduino Web Editor **[2]**, by just installing a simple plugin.
The Arduino Web Editor is hosted online, therefore it will always be up-to-date with the latest features and support for all boards. Follow **[3]** to start coding on the browser and upload your sketches onto your board.

### Sample Sketches
Sample sketches for the Arduino® can be found either in the “Examples” menu in the Arduino® IDE or in the “Documentation” section of the Arduino website **[4]**

### Online Resources
Now that you have gone through the basics of what you can do with the board you can explore the endless possibilities it provides by checking exciting projects on ProjectHub **[5]**, the Arduino® Library Reference **[6]** and the online store **[7]** where you will be able to complement your board with sensors, actuators and more.
