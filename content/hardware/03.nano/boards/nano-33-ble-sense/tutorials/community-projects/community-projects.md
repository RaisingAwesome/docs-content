The Nano BLE Sense is a fantastic, versatile board that can be used for environmental & gesture sensing, machine learning and connectivity projects. In this article you will find great videos and articles related to the [Nano BLE Sense board](https://store.arduino.cc/products/arduino-nano-33-ble-sense), made by our amazing community of makers.

Picovoice is a platform for creating voice AI applications, and they have implemented support for the Nano BLE Sense. The example above teaches us how to set different parameters on the board, such as **speed, iterations** and **color**, using only our voice.
