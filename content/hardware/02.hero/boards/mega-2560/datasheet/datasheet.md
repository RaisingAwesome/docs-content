## The Board

Arduino® Mega 2560 is a successor board of Arduino Mega,  it is dedicated to applications and projects that require large number of input output pins and the use cases which need high processing power. The Arduino® Mega 2560 comes with a much larger set of IOs when we compare it with traditional Uno board considering the form factor of both the boards.

### Application Examples

- **Robotics**: Featuring the high processing capacitity, the Arduino Mega 2560 can handle the extensive robotic applications. It is compatible with the motor controller shield that enables it to control multiple motors at an instance, thus making it perfect of robotic applications. The large number of I/O pins can accommodate many robotic sensors as well.

- **3D Printing**: Algorithms play a significant role in implementation of 3D printers. Arduino Mega 2560 has the power to process these complex algorithms required for 3D printing. Additionally, the slight changes to the code is easily possible with the Arduino IDE and thus 3D printing programs can be customized according to user requirements.

- **Wi-Fi**: Integrating wireless functionality enhances the utility of the applications. Arduino Mega 2560 is compatible with WiFi shields hence allowing the wireless features for the applications in 3D printing and Robotics.

### Processor
Primary processor of Arduino Mega 2560 Rev3 board is ATmega2560 chip which operates at a frequency of 16 MHz. It accommodates a large number of input and output lines which gives the provision of interfacing many external devices. At the same time the operations and processing is not slowed due to its significantly larger RAM than the other processors. The board also features a USB serial processor ATmega16U2 which acts an interface between the USB input signals and the main processor. This increases the flexibility of interfacing and connecting peripherals to the Arduino Mega 2560 Rev 3 board.
